# ADR-template

Markdown template for Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Usage guidelines:
 - Each ADR is a plain text, 1-2 page document
 - ADRs should be numbered
 - ADRs should be stored within each software project repo
 - Create a separate repo for crosscutting ADRs
 - This template is an example. You can adapt or create your own. But do establish and share a template for ADRs in your team or organization
 - Track ADRs in the backlog
 - Review ADRs
 - Create ADRs for *significant* design decisions
